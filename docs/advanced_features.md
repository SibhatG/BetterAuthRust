# Advanced Authentication Features

This document covers the advanced authentication features implemented in the Better Auth system.

## FIDO2/WebAuthn Passwordless Authentication

WebAuthn allows users to authenticate using hardware security keys, biometrics, or platform authenticators.

### Features

- **Passwordless Authentication**: Users can log in without typing passwords
- **Phishing-Resistant**: WebAuthn is resistant to phishing attacks
- **Multi-Device Support**: Register multiple security keys or biometric devices
- **Platform Authenticator Support**: Use Windows Hello, Touch ID, etc.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/webauthn/register/start`: Start registration of a new passkey
- `POST /api/auth/webauthn/register/complete`: Complete registration of a passkey
- `POST /api/auth/webauthn/login/start`: Start authentication with passkey
- `POST /api/auth/webauthn/login/complete`: Complete authentication with passkey

## AI-based Risk Scoring System

The risk scoring system analyzes login patterns to identify suspicious activity.

### Features

- **Login Pattern Analysis**: Tracks when and where users typically log in
- **Impossible Travel Detection**: Flags logins from geographically distant locations in short time periods
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Identifies new or unusual devices
- **Adaptive Authentication**: Requires MFA only when risk is detected
- **Configurable Risk Thresholds**: Set different security levels for different user groups

### Risk Factors

- New device or location
- Unusual login time
- Impossible travel speed
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Login from high-risk countries

## Automated Breach Detection and Response

Automatically detects compromised credentials and responds appropriately.

### Features

- **Compromised Password Detection**: Checks passwords against breach databases
- **Automated Response**: Forces password resets when compromised credentials are detected
- **Session Invalidation**: Terminates all active sessions when a breach is detected
- **Breach Notification**: Alerts users when their credentials appear in known breaches

### Integration

- Uses a "Have I Been Pwned" style API to check password hashes
- Performs breach checks during registration and login
- Periodically checks existing credentials against new breaches

## Proxy Email System ("Hide My Email")

Provides users with randomly generated email addresses that forward to their real email.

### Features

- **Email Privacy**: Users can keep their real email addresses private
- **Unique Addresses**: Generate a different address for each service
- **Forwarding Control**: Enable/disable forwarding for specific addresses
- **Spam Protection**: Block unwanted senders
- **One-Click Disable**: Easily stop receiving emails from specific services

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/email/create`: Generate a new proxy email address
- `GET /api/email/list`: List all proxy email addresses
- `PATCH /api/email/status`: Update status of a proxy email
- `DELETE /api/email/delete`: Delete a proxy email
- `PATCH /api/email/preferences`: Update forwarding preferences

## Hybrid Encryption (RSA + CRYSTALS-Kyber)

Future-proof encryption combining traditional and post-quantum algorithms.

### Features

- **Post-Quantum Security**: Protected against quantum computer attacks
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing systems that support RSA
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines classical RSA with post-quantum Kyber
- **Automatic Fallback**: If one encryption method fails, the other still protects the data
- **Token Encryption**: Uses hybrid encryption to secure session tokens

### Implementation

- RSA for traditional cryptographic security
- CRYSTALS-Kyber for post-quantum security
- AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption
- Secure key management with regular key rotation

## Accessibility Features

Enhanced accessibility features to ensure authentication is available to all users.

### Features

- **Screen Reader Optimization**: Works well with JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, etc.
- **Voice Control**: Authentication using voice commands
- **High Contrast Themes**: Improves visibility for visually impaired users
- **Large Text Mode**: Increases text size for better readability
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete authentication without a mouse
- **Alternative CAPTCHAs**: Audio and logic-based alternatives to visual CAPTCHAs

### Customization

- Per-user accessibility preferences
- Remembers settings across sessions
- Automatic detection of system accessibility settings

## HIPAA Compliance

Features to ensure compliance with healthcare privacy regulations.

### Features

- **Automatic Session Timeout**: Sessions expire after 2 minutes of inactivity
- **PHI Access Logging**: Detailed logs of all access to protected health information
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions based on user roles
- **Emergency Access**: Break-glass procedures for emergency situations
- **Audit Reports**: Comprehensive reports for compliance audits
- **Business Associate Agreements**: BAA management tools

### Compliance Reports

- Access logs for PHI data
- User activity reports
- Emergency access audit trails
- Regular compliance status reports
